### `<Suspense/>`

@suspensive/react's `<Suspense/>` will be just Suspense of original React.

### `<Suspense.CSROnly/>`

`<Suspense.CSROnly/>` will return fallback first. After mount, return children only in client. but in server, return fallback only.

### props.fallback

fallback works the same as Suspense of original React.

```tsx
import { Suspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
    <Children />
  </Suspense>
)

const Example = () => (
  <Suspense.CSROnly fallback={<Loading />}>
    <Children />
  </Suspense.CSROnly>
)
```

#### Default fallback

`<Suspsense/>` and `<Suspsense.CSROnly/>` are more powerful when used with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`.
Control multiple `<Suspense/>`s default fallback with `<SuspensiveProvider/>`.

Details are introduced in [`<SuspensiveProvider/>` page](./SuspensiveProvider.i18n).

## withSuspense

You can use withSuspense to wrap component by `<Suspense/>` easily.
we don't need to make unncessary code to wrap it if we use withSuspense like below.
withSuspense's 2nd parameter is props of `<Suspense/>` without children

```tsx
import { withSuspense } from '@suspensive/react'

const Example = withSuspense(
  function Component() {
    // code make suspending

    return <>...</>
  },
  { fallback: <Spinner /> }
)

const Example = withSuspense.CSROnly(
  function Component() {
    // code make suspending

    return <>...</>
  },
  { fallback: <Spinner /> }
)
```

#### Migration support SSR gradually (`<Suspense.CSROnly/>` -> `<Suspense/>`)

If you want to use Suspense working in both SSR/CSR, You can change `<Suspense.CSROnly/>` to `<Suspense/>` gradually.
