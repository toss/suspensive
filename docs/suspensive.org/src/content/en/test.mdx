# Test Page

This is a test page to verify that Nextra has been successfully removed and MDX is working with pure Next.js.

## Features

- Pure Next.js setup with @next/mdx
- No Nextra dependencies
- Custom theme provider using next-themes
- Simplified layout

## Code Example

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>
}
```

This demonstrates that MDX processing is working correctly without Nextra.
