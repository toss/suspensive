title: Migrating to v2

# Migrating to v2

@suspensive/react-query v1 was originally [added as one of TanStack Query's community resources](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/community/suspensive-react-query) and was a library that provided `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries` and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` to users of @tanstack/react-query v4.
Afterwards, [as `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` were officially added to @tanstack/react-query v5](https://github.com/TanStack/query/pull/5739) with changes interfaces such as enabled disappeared and queryOptions were received as one.
Therefore **we made the interface of @suspensive/react-query v2 as similar to the official interface as possible to make it easier for existing users of @suspensive/react-query v1 to migrate to @tanstack/react-query v5**.

However, because of [the higher browser specifications (class private fields) required by @tanstack/react-query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/installation#requirements), @tanstack/react-query v4 is still useful to many teams.
Therefore, we will maintain support for @tanstack/react-query v4.

## What's new

### New `<SuspenseQuery/>`, `<SuspenseInfiniteQuery/>` [#775](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/775)

Because the existing useSuspenseQuery is a hook, it creates components with names such as AuthorInfo and PostList to place Suspense and ErrorBoundary on the parent.
This makes it difficult to predict what suspense and errors will be thrown inside AuthorInfo and PostList.

#### Motivation: Want to expose that suspense occurs in child components.

```jsx
// posts/page.tsx
import { Suspense, ErrorBoundary } from '@suspensive/react'
import { AuthorInfo } from './components/AuthorInfo'
import { PostList } from './components/PostList'

const PostsPage = ({ userId }) => (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={({ error }) => <>{error.message}</>}>
    <Suspense fallback={'loading...'}>
      <AuthorInfo userId={userId} />
      {/* It is difficult to predict whether a suspension will occur internally. */}
      <PostList userId={userId} />
      {/* It is difficult to predict whether a suspension will occur internally. */}
    </Suspense>
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

```jsx
// posts/components/AuthorInfo.tsx
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'
import { AuthorProfile } from '~/components'

// From the perspective of using this component, it is impossible to predict whether Suspense will occur internally just by the name AuthorInfo.
const AuthorInfo = ({ userId }) => {
  // We need to create this component just for data-fetching.
  const { data: author } = useSuspenseQuery(userQueryOptions(userId))

  return <AuthorProfile {...author} />
}
```

```jsx
// posts/components/PostList.tsx
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'
import { PostListItem } from '~/components'

// From the perspective of using this component, it is impossible to predict whether a suspense will occur internally based on the name PostList alone.
const PostList = ({ userId }) => {
   // We need to create this component just for data-fetching.
   const { data: posts } = useSuspenseQuery({
     ...postsQueryOptions(userId);
     select: (posts) => posts.filter(({ isShow }) => isShow),
   })

   return (
     <>
       {posts.map((post) => (
         <PostListItem {...post} />
       ))}
     </>
   )
}
```

#### Solution: Let's reveal that suspense occurs with `<SuspenseQuery/>`

Therefore, we provide these components to clearly express what causes suspension at the same depth.

1. Prop-drilling resulting from removing depth such as AuthorInfo and PostList for data-fetching only is also removed.
2. Changing the range of Suspense and ErrorBoundary becomes simple. Parallel processing of queries is also easier.
3. Because it manages all data-fetching within the Page component, the internal components are presentational, so it is easy to separate the components.

```jsx
import { SuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'
import { Suspense, ErrorBoundary } from '@suspensive/react'
import { PostListItem, AuthorProfile } from '~/components'

const PostsPage = ({ authorId }) => (
  <ErrorBoundary fallback={({ error }) => <>{error.message}</>}>
    <Suspense fallback={'loading...'}>
      <SuspenseQuery {...userQueryOptions(authorId)}>
        {({ data: author }) => <AuthorProfile {...author} />}
      </SuspenseQuery>
      <SuspenseQuery
        {...postsQueryOptions(authorId)}
        select={(posts) => posts.filter(({ isShow }) => isShow)}
      >
        {({ data: posts }) => posts.map((post) => <PostListItem {...post} />)}
      </SuspenseQuery>
    </Suspense>
  </ErrorBoundary>
)
```

### New `queryOptions` [#828](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/828)

Tkdodo, The maintainer of TanStack Query explains well why this interface is needed in [video explaining queryOptions in TanStack Query v5](https://youtu.be/bhE3wuB_TuA?feature=shared&t=1697).
You can also use queryOptions in TanStack Query v4.

1. QueryKey management becomes easier by processing queryKey and queryFn together.
2. You can remove unnecessary custom query hooks. This is because they can all be used directly in `useQuery`, `useQueries` of TanStack Query v4, and `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, and `SuspenseQuery` of Suspensive React Query.
3. TanStack Query v5 already supports queryOptions. This Suspensive React Query's `queryOptions` will make migration from TanStack Query v4 to TanStack Query v5 easier.

```jsx /queryOptions/
import { queryOptions, useSuspenseQuery, useSuspenseQueries, SuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'
import { useQuery, useQueries, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query'

const postQueryOptions = (postId) =>
   queryOptions({
     queryKey: ['posts', postId] as const,
     queryFn: ({
       queryKey: [, postId], // You can use queryKey.
     }) => fetch(`https://example.com/posts/${postId}`),
   })

// No need to create custom query hooks.
// You can use queryOptions directly in useQuery, useQueries, useSuspenseQuery, useSuspenseQueries, SuspenseQuery.
const post1Query = useQuery(postQueryOptions(1))
const { data: post1 } = useSuspenseQuery({
   ...postQueryOptions(1);
   refetchInterval: 2000, // Extensibility is clearly expressed in usage.
})
const [post1Query, post2Query] = useQueries({
   queries: [postQueryOptions(1), { ...postQueryOptions(2), refetchInterval: 2000 }],
})
const [{ data: post1 }, { data: post2 }] = useSuspenseQueries({
   queries: [postQueryOptions(1), { ...postQueryOptions(2), refetchInterval: 2000 }],
})
const Example = () => (
  <SuspenseQuery {...postQueryOptions(1)}>
    {({ data: post1 }) => <>{post1.text}</>}
  </SuspenseQuery>
);

// You can easily use queryKey and queryFn in queryClient's methods.
const queryClient = useQueryClient()
queryClient.refetchQueries(postQueryOptions(1))
queryClient.prefetchQuery(postQueryOptions(1))
queryClient.invalidateQueries(postQueryOptions(1))
queryClient.fetchQuery(postQueryOptions(1))
queryClient.resetQueries(postQueryOptions(1))
queryClient.cancelQueries(postQueryOptions(1))

```

## Handling BREAKING CHANGES

### Removed `enabled`, `placeholderData` option of `useSuspenseQuery`

```diff
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api.text()
-   enabled: Math.random() > 0.5,
-   placeholderData: 'placeholder'
  })
}
```

### Removed `enabled`, `placeholderData` option of `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery`

```diff
import { useSuspenseInfiniteQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const Example = () => {
  const infiniteQuery = useSuspenseInfiniteQuery({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api.text()
-   enabled: Math.random() > 0.5,
-   placeholderData: 'placeholder'
  })
}
```

### Unified interface naming for options and return type of `useSuspenseQuery` same with @tanstack/react-query v5's useSuspenseQuery

```diff filename="index.ts of @suspensive/react-query"
export { useSuspenseQuery } from './useSuspenseQuery'
export type {
- BaseUseSuspenseQueryResult,
  UseSuspenseQueryOptions,
- UseSuspenseQueryResultOnLoading,
- UseSuspenseQueryResultOnSuccess,
+ UseSuspenseQueryResult
} from './useSuspenseQuery'
export { useSuspenseQueries } from './useSuspenseQueries'
+ export type { SuspenseQueriesOptions, SuspenseQueriesResults } from './useSuspenseQueries'
export { useSuspenseInfiniteQuery } from './useSuspenseInfiniteQuery'
export type {
- BaseUseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResult,
  UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryOptions,
- UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResultOnLoading,
- UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResultOnSuccess,
+ UseSuspenseInfiniteQueryResult
} from './useSuspenseInfiniteQuery'
- export { QueryAsyncBoundary } from './QueryAsyncBoundary'
export { QueryErrorBoundary } from './QueryErrorBoundary'
```
