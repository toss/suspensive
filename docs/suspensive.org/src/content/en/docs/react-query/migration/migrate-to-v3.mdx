# Migrating to v3

@suspensive/react-query v1 was originally [added as one of TanStack Query's community resources](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/community/suspensive-react-query) and was a library that provided `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries` and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` to users of @tanstack/react-query v4.
Afterwards, [as `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, and `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` were officially added to @tanstack/react-query v5](https://github.com/TanStack/query/pull/5739) with changes interfaces such as enabled disappeared and queryOptions were received as one.
Therefore **we made the interface of @suspensive/react-query v2 as similar to the official interface as possible to make it easier for existing users of @suspensive/react-query v1 to migrate to @tanstack/react-query v5**.

However, because of [the higher browser specifications (class private fields) required by @tanstack/react-query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/installation#requirements), @tanstack/react-query v4 is still useful to many teams.
Therefore, we will maintain support for @tanstack/react-query v4.

## What's new

### New `mutationOptions` [#1490](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/1490)

`mutationOptions` helps you easily reuse and consistently manage option objects for Mutations. This provides similar benefits to the ones offered by [`queryOptions`](/docs/react-query/queryOptions).

```jsx /mutationOptions/
import { mutationOptions, useMutation, Mutation } from '@suspensive/react-query'

const editPostMutationOptions = (postId: number) =>
  mutationOptions({
    mutationFn: (content: string) => fetch(`https://example.com/posts/${postId}`, {
      method: 'PATCH',
      body: JSON.stringify({ content }),
    }).then(res => res.json()),
  })

// You can directly use mutationOptions without creating custom mutation hooks.
const editPostMutation = useMutation(editPostMutationOptions(1))

// Directly use mutationOptions with <Mutation />.
const Example = () => (
  <Mutation {...editPostMutationOptions(1)}>
    {({ mutate, isLoading }) => (
      <div>
        <p>{isLoading ? 'Updating...' : 'Latest updated'}</p>
        <textarea onBlur={(e) => mutate(e.target.value)} disabled={isLoading} />
      </div>
    )}
  </Mutation>
)
```

## Handling BREAKING CHANGES

### `networkMode` is now fixed to `'always'` in `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseQueries`, `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery` of `@suspensive/react-query`

<Callout type='info'>

This breaking change affects users who use both `@tanstack/react-query` v4 and `@suspensive/react-query`.

</Callout>

Previously, online status was determined using the `navigator.onLine` API. However, Chromium-based browsers have a known issue where this API may return incorrect values, falsely reporting the device as offline even when it is connected.  
To ensure consistent behavior across all environments, `@suspensive/react-query` now sets the default `networkMode` to `'always'` when using Suspense hooks.

This change aligns with the default behavior in React Query v5 and prevents Suspense hooks from starting with `fetchStatus: 'paused'` during runtime.

- Reference: [Default networkMode configuration and fetchStatus = "paused"](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/4753), [navigator.onLine returning false value even network is available](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/338514113)

```diff
import { queryOptions, useSuspenseQuery } from '@suspensive/react-query'

// Applies the same to queryOptions and infiniteQueryOptions as well.
const QueryOptionsExample = () => {
  const options = queryOptions({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api()
-   networkMode: 'always'
  })
}

// Applies the same to useSuspenseQuery, useSuspenseInfiniteQuery, SuspenseQuery, and SuspenseInfiniteQuery.
const SuspenseQueryExample = () => {
  const query = useSuspenseQuery({
    queryKey: ['key'],
    queryFn: () => api()
-   networkMode: 'always'
  })
}
```
