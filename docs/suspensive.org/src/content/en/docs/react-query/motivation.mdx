# Why need to use?

@suspensive/react-query is used with the following motivation:

<Steps>

### Hooks for Suspense are also available in @tanstack/react-query v4. (as well as @tanstack/react-query v5)

[useSuspenseQuery](/docs/react-query/useSuspenseQuery), [useSuspenseQueries](/docs/react-query/useSuspenseQueries), and [useSuspenseInfiniteQuery](/docs/react-query/useSuspenseInfiniteQuery), which were not originally available in @tanstack/react-query v4, can now be used. Currently, this hook is officially provided in @tanstack/react-query v5, making it a good alternative for migrating from @tanstack/react-query v4 to v5.

### Solution for [the issue of @tanstack/react-query v5 not being able to support lower version browsers due to es private field](https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/6371#issuecomment-1810246027)

<Callout type='info'>

From version 2.2.0 onwards, @tanstack/react-query supports both v4 and v5. To support older browser versions, use @suspensive/react-query with @tanstack/react-query v4.

</Callout>

Apart from performance, many places still need to support lower browser versions such as Safari 12.1, 13, and 14. However, the browser compatibility of @tanstack/react-query v5 may limit its use because it targets high browser environments such as safari>=15.

- Please check [Why @tanstack/react-query v5 only support versions with high browser compatibility (es private field)](https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/6371#issuecomment-1810246027).

In this case, @suspensive/react-query can be a good alternative to use with @tanstack/react-query v4 to help you use the interface of @tanstack/react-query v5.
(@suspensive/react-query uses @tanstack/react-query v4 internally, allowing it to support Suspense and related hooks while maintaining lower version browser support.)
