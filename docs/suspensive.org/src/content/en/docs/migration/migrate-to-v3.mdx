# Migrating to Suspensive v3

Suspensive v3 introduces several important changes to improve stability and add new features.

### Stabilized experimental Suspensive packages

- [@suspensive/jotai](../jotai/motivation)
- [@suspensive/codemods](../codemods/motivation) - [#1461](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/1461)

### Prevent infinite loop when an error occurs in the ErrorBoundary fallback

The way errors are handled in the `fallback` of `ErrorBoundary` in @suspensive/react has changed. [#1409](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/1409)

### Removed peerDependency of @suspensive/react-query

We no longer depend on @suspensive/react as a peerDependency. It was only used to provide `QueryErrorBoundary`.
This simplifies the usage of @suspensive/react-query, ensuring that users do not need to use any additional libraries other than @tanstack/react-query. [#1434](https://github.com/toss/suspensive/pull/1434)

## Thanks to all Suspensive contributors

We were able to release v3 because of Suspensive's contributors. Thank you to everyone who worked together to make it a better library, and we look forward to your continued support.
