# Usage

You can run Suspensive's Codemods with a single command, easily using npx without the need to install it as a dependency.

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run the following command.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@suspensive/codemods?color=000&labelColor=000&logo=npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suspensive/codemods)

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx @suspensive/codemods <transform> <path>
```

Adjust `<transform>` and `<path>` to match the environment where you want to apply the codemod.

- `<transform>`: name of transform
- `<path>`: files or directory to transform

You can use the following options.

- `--dry`: Output the transformation result without modifying the file.
- `--print`: Output the transformation result to the console.
