# Why need to use?

@suspensive/react is used with the following motivation:

<Steps>

### React Suspense need to avoid Server side rendering sometimes.

If you have used React Suspense in SSR environment like Next.js, you may encounter error like below.

It's why [clientOnly prop of `<Suspense/>`](/docs/react/Suspense) is added in this library.

### ErrorBoundary more simply

[bvaughn/react-error-boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) that provide ErrorBoundary is popular library to use React's error-boundary concept declaratively. ErrorBoundary of bvaughn/react-error-boundary have fallback prop named like FallbackComponent, fallbackRender, fallback. We wanted to use the existing ErrorBoundary's somewhat complex fallback interface in something simpler like @suspensive/react's `<ErrorBoundary/>`.

It's why [`<ErrorBoundary/>`](/docs/react/ErrorBoundary) is added in this library.

### Resetting multiple `<ErrorBoundary/>`s outside of fallback itself easily

To reset `<ErrorBoundary/>`, you can use reset method provided by fallback prop of `<ErrorBoundary/>`.
but If you want to reset multiple `<ErrorBoundary/>`s outside of its fallback, you have to provide new element of resetKeys to props of each `<ErrorBoundary/>`s. but If you use @suspensive/react's `<ErrorBoundaryGroup/>`, You don't need to do this tiresome. `<ErrorBoundaryGroup/>` will reset multiple `<ErrorBoundary/>`s easily.

It's why [`<ErrorBoundaryGroup/>`](/docs/react/ErrorBoundaryGroup) is added in this library.

</Steps>
